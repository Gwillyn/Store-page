**An example store page**    
Just a test website for what a store page could look like.  
Minimal aesthetic.  
WIP... visit how it looks so far [here](https://gwillynstore.netlify.app/)!  
issues so far: 
  Modal() element is not showing properly on IOS devices, so safari might not be supported for that.
